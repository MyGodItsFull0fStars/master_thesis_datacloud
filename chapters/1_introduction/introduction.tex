\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

    Modern large scale systems that contain a vast amount of heterogeneous resources require complex workflow sequences in order to functionally operate. Additionally, specific domain knowledge is required to be able to properly map tasks residing on a big data pipeline onto heterogeneous resources. Yet, this often results in a degradation of the performance of the system since research shows that humans tend to over-provision the available resources.

        In a data center, computing resources such as CPU and memory are usually managed by a resource manager. The resource manager accepts resource requests from users and allocates resources to their applications. A commonly known problem in resource management is that users often request more resources than their applications actually use. This leads to the degradation of overall resource utilization in a data center. \cite{thonglekImprovingResourceUtilization2019}

    This chapter covers the introduction of the master thesis.
    First, the motivation and scope of the thesis will be described in section \ref{sec:motivation-and-scope-introduction}.
    Followed by the explanation, what the existing research problems are, that we want to improve upon in section \ref{sec:research-problems-introduction}. Next are the research objectives in section \ref{sec:research-objectives-introduction}, that describe briefly what the gained insights and improvements upon the research problems are. In the section \ref{sec:research-methodology-introduction} the methodology of this thesis is described. And in the section \ref{sec:thesis-outline-introduction} the outline of the thesis briefly describes the structure and content of all subsequent chapters.

        \section{Motivation and Scope}
        \label{sec:motivation-and-scope-introduction}

            This masters thesis is a product of the work done for the project \emph{DataCloud} and a produced paper \emph{Big Data Pipeline Scheduling and Adaptation on the Computing Continuum} \cite{kimovskiBigDataPipeline2022}.

                The Computing Continuum, covering Cloud, Fog, and Edge systems, promises to provide on-demand resource-as-a-service for Internet applications with diverse requirements, ranging from extremely low latency to high-performance processing. However, eminent challenges in automating the resources management of Big Data pipelines across the Computing Continuum remain. The resource management and adaptation for Big Data pipelines across the Computing Continuum require significant research effort, as the current data processing pipelines are dynamic. In contrast, traditional resource management strategies are static, leading to inefficient pipeline scheduling and overly complex process deployment. To address these needs, we propose in this work a scheduling and adaptation approach implemented as a software tool to lower the technological barriers to the management of Big Data pipelines over the Computing Continuum. The approach separates the static scheduling from the run-time execution, em-powering domain experts with little infrastructure and software knowledge to take an active part in the Big Data pipeline adaptation. We conduct a feasibility study using a digital healthcare use case to validate our approach. We illustrate concrete scenarios supported by demonstrating how the scheduling and adaptation tool and its implementation automate the management of the lifecycle of a remote patient monitoring, treatment, and care pipeline. \cite{kimovskiBigDataPipeline2022}

            Our motivation is to improve the resource utilisation in systems consisting of a vast amount of computing resources, which in term also results in reduced costs for the providers as well as reduced energy consumption based on the amount of tasks finished.
            The wastage occurring in utilizing resources on large scale systems (or computing clusters) is further described in sections \ref{sec:public-cloud-provider-traces-in-available-data-related-work} and \ref{sec:data-analysis-evaluation}.
            The reduction of the resource wastage is presented by our \nameref{sec:scheduling-and-adaptation-background} approach. 
            This approach consists of two main parts. One is the matching game based scheduling algorithm, which is presented in the publication \emph{Matching-based Scheduling of Asynchronous Data Processing Workflows on the Computing Continuum} \cite{mehranMatchingbasedSchedulingAsynchronous2022} that decides which tasks are mapped to a resource via a two-sided ranking procedure, and second is the adaptation, that consists of continuous monitoring of the tasks and resources, as well as analysis of both and adapting them depending with the help of various tools.

        \section{Research Problems}
        \label{sec:research-problems-introduction}

        The deviation of the predicted provisioning or utilisation of heterogeneous resources done by humans often leads to degradation of the entire system. Those degradation includes deployed tasks not finishing within an expected time frame or even in failure of a resource, degrading the stability of the system further. 
        \begin{quote}
            In practice, the planned or expected performance of production units often deviates from the actual performance. Most of these deviations are negative, which means that the actual performance is worse than the expected performance. Apparently, expectations about future performances are often too optimistic. \cite{stoopComplexitySchedulingPractice1996}
        \end{quote}
        Naive predictions of the resource utilisation generated by humans are likely to be over-utilizing resources, which leads to resource wastage since those resources are not optimally operating.
