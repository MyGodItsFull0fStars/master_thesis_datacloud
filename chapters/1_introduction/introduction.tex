\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

    Modern large-scale distributed infrastructures that consist of a vast amount of heterogeneous resources require complex workflow sequences in order to functionally operate. Additionally, specific domain knowledge is required to be able to properly map tasks residing on a big data pipeline onto heterogeneous resources. Yet, this often results in a degradation of the performance of the system since research shows that humans tend to over-provision the available resources.

        In a data center, computing resources such as CPU and memory are usually managed by a resource manager. The resource manager accepts resource requests from users and allocates resources to their applications. A commonly known problem in resource management is that users often request more resources than their applications actually use. This leads to the degradation of overall resource utilization in a data center \cite{thonglekImprovingResourceUtilization2019}.

        \section{Motivation and Scope}
        \label{sec:motivation-and-scope-introduction}

            The motivation is to improve resource utilisation in distributed infrastructures. The targeted distributed infrastructures consist of a vast amount of computing resources on cloud, fog and edge layers.
            Mapping and deploying tasks on these infrastructures is a challenging problem. In order to enable large-scale distributed infrastructures to function properly, it is necessary to provide estimates regarding the resource utilisation of deployable tasks to these infrastructures.
            A major problem when providing resource utilisation estimates is their quality of accuracy, as shown by the authors of \cite{thonglekImprovingResourceUtilization2019}, tasks provided by users overestimate the resource utilisation by more than $30\%$ on average. 
            This results in a higher resource allocation than necessary to execute and finish tasks in time and also results in a less stable infrastructure since tasks might not be deployed on fitting resources, since all their capacity might be allocated.
            Task scheduling with communication delays is a well-researched problem that is known to be strongly NP-hard problems for both homogeneous and heterogeneous resources \cite{orrOptimalTaskScheduling2021}.
            Numerous polynomial-time heuristic algorithms have been proposed that provide non-optimal solutions, yet do so within a reasonable time frame in order to be used for scheduling. Recent developments in machine learning and large datasets that trace the behaviour of hyper-scale data centres \cite{vanooteghemWhatHyperscaleData2023} while executing various task types lay a promising groundwork to use deep learning techniques to provide a resource utilisation estimator that is trained on said immense amount of data and then fine-tuned for the specific infrastructure it is part of. 
            Various machine learning approaches to improve resource utilisation prediction and scheduling emerged in recent years as are mentioned in section \ref{ch:state-of-the-art}. Yet, there is no consensus on the best machine learning approach and while task scheduling is challenging, 
            deep learning algorithms made promising progress in providing more accurate predictors in many fields.

        %         The Computing Continuum, covering Cloud, Fog, and Edge systems, promises to provide on-demand resource-as-a-service for Internet applications with diverse requirements, ranging from extremely low latency to high-performance processing. However, eminent challenges in automating the resources management of Big Data pipelines across the Computing Continuum remain. The resource management and adaptation for Big Data pipelines across the Computing Continuum require significant research effort, as the current data processing pipelines are dynamic. In contrast, traditional resource management strategies are static, leading to inefficient pipeline scheduling and overly complex process deployment. To address these needs, we propose in this work a scheduling and adaptation approach implemented as a software tool to lower the technological barriers to the management of Big Data pipelines over the Computing Continuum. The approach separates the static scheduling from the run-time execution, empowering domain experts with little infrastructure and software knowledge to take an active part in the Big Data pipeline adaptation. We conduct a feasibility study using a digital healthcare use case to validate our approach. We illustrate concrete scenarios supported by demonstrating how the scheduling and adaptation tool and its implementation automate the management of the lifecycle of a remote patient monitoring, treatment, and care pipeline \cite{kimovskiBigDataPipeline2022}.

        \section{Research Problems}
        \label{sec:research-problems-introduction}

            The deviation of the predicted provisioning or utilisation of heterogeneous resources done by humans often leads to the degradation of the entire system. That degradation includes deployed tasks not finishing within an expected time frame or even the failure of a resource, degrading the stability of the system further.
            \begin{quote}
                In practice, the planned or expected performance of production units often deviates from the actual performance. Most of these deviations are negative, which means that the actual performance is worse than the expected performance. Apparently, expectations about future performances are often too optimistic \cite{stoopComplexitySchedulingPractice1996}.
            \end{quote}
            Naive predictions of the resource utilisation generated by humans are likely to be over-utilising resources, which leads to resource wastage since those resources are not optimally operating. 
            
            These deviations from the actual values are also referred to as \emph{disturbances}.
            As is stated in \cite{stoopComplexitySchedulingPractice1996}, these disturbances can be divided into three categories:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Disturbances regarding the capacity,
                \item Disturbances related to orders,
                \item Disturbances related to the measurement of data.
            \end{enumerate}
            While the paper uses the disturbances on \emph{production scheduling}, i.e. finding a schedule for a real facility, the propositions can be translated into our domain of distributed systems that represent the machines/workers and big data pipelines filled with tasks that represent the tasks that are to be scheduled to the machines. After scheduling and deploying the tasks onto the machines, they need to be executed or finished by a worker.
            Capacity disturbances are caused by the machine's capacity and involve scenarios such as partial or complete failure of a hardware resource or trying to execute tasks on resources that are not capable of handling those tasks because the specific requirements are not met.
        
            Order-related disturbances are aspects that delay the process of individual orders (tasks).
            This could be the unavailability of required data that is calculated by a preceding task the current task depends on which has not finished its execution.

            The disturbance related to the measurement of data is that of processing times and hardware utilisation requirements that are estimated before deploying a task onto the distributed system. 
            This type of disturbance is the aforementioned deviation of the predicted utilisation of heterogeneous resources that are investigated in this thesis. These cover the hardware utilisation requirements and the already existing estimations done by domain experts and users. While analysing the monitoring traces of popular cloud providers, it becomes apparent that hardware is not optimally used.
