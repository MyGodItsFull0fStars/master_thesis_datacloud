\chapter{State of the Art}

    Go based on the objectives or machine learning methods, research prediction....
    Categorization of state of the art, how many papers are there for cloud, fog, or for machine learning stuff.

    This section is for my competing approaches.

    \section{Long-Short Term Memory}
    \label{sec:lstm-sota}

        \emph{Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)} are a type of \emph{Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)} but improve upon the shortcomings of regular RNN models.
        LSTMs are best suited for learning long term dependencies in sequential or time-series data.

        The introduction of \emph{self-looping} to produce paths is the main architectural improvement for LSTMs over RNNs. This additional component diminishes the problem of the vanishing gradients problem and enables gradients to flow for a long duration.
