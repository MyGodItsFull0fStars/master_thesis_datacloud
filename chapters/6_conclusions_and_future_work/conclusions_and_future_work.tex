    \section{Future Work}
    \label{sec:future-work}

        \subsection{Energy Consumption}
        \label{sec:energy-consumption-future-work}

            % Energy Consumption of Machine Learning Algorithms while training, inference
            % Also consumption of task execution on GPU clusters, and if energy can be saved by using smarter predictors

        \subsection{Adaptation Loop}
        \label{sec:adaptation-loop-future-work}

            % Mention that the adaptation is not fully tested or included
            % Mention that the adaptation loop should be tested with some edge cases such as really bad schedule and how it is corrected

        \subsection{Comparison with other Datasets}
        \label{sec:comparison-with-other-datasets-future-work}

            % Mention the Google Cluster Dataset and also the other Alibaba datasets

        \subsection{Analyse the Dependencies of Tasks}
        \label{sec:analyse-the-dependencies-of-tasks-future-work}

            % Explain that the current dataset does not have dependencies 
            % And that this is a future improvement to the current state

        \subsection{Explore other Machine Learning Algorithms}
        \label{sec:explore-other-machine-learning-algorithms-future-work}

            % Mention to include other ML algos to the LSTM to see if improvements are possible such as VAE after LSTM
            % Mention GNN as another approach

    % * Energy 
    % -- to see the influence of the energy consumption and possible improvement.
    % -- to investigate if energy was reduced or not
    % * Adaption Loop
    % * Compare with other datasets
    % * Analyze the dependencies of tasks
    % * Explore with other ML ALGOS such as GNN
