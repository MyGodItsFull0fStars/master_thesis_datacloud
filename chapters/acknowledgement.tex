    First, let me thank Dragi Kimovski for assisting me with this Master's thesis through his advice, excellent mentoring as well as his warm character, humour and kindness.
    I thank Narges Mehran for the valuable insights gained during our discussions and the snacks that recharged our spirits.
    Also, I'd like to thank my cat Tinka for occasionally being a little fluff of cuddliness.
    Finally, I want to thank my girlfriend Raffaela Mori for her encouragement, understanding, and patience during the period of this work as well as for being the amazing person that inspires me, makes me laugh and makes me feel at home.
