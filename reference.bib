We identify a weakness of LSTM networks processing continual input streams that are not a priori segmented into subsequences with explicitly marked ends at which the network's internal state could be reset. Without resets, the state may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is a novel, adaptive ``forget gate'' that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review illustrative benchmark problems on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve continual versions of these problems. LSTM with forget gates, however, easily solves them, and in an elegant way.},

Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this pa- per we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hi- erarchical processing on difficult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modelling when trained with sim- ple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based edge-enhancement network (EEGAN) for robust satellite image SR reconstruction along with the adversarial learning strategy that is insensitive to noise. In particular, EEGAN consists of two main subnetworks: an ultradense subnetwork (UDSN) and an edge-enhancement subnetwork (EESN). In UDSN, a group of 2-D dense blocks is assembled for feature extraction and to obtain an intermediate high-resolution result that looks sharp but is eroded with artifacts and noises as previous GAN-based methods do. Then, EESN is constructed to extract and enhance the image contours by purifying the noise-contaminated components with mask processing. The recovered intermediate image and enhanced edges can be combined to generate the result that enjoys high credibility and clear contents. Extensive experiments on Kaggle Open Source Data set, Jilin-1 video satellite images, and Digitalglobe show superior reconstruction performance compared to the state-of-the-art SR approaches.},

  abstract = {The Computing Continuum, covering Cloud, Fog, and Edge systems, promises to provide on-demand resource-as-a-service for Internet applications with diverse requirements, ranging from extremely low latency to high-performance processing. However, eminent challenges in automating the resources man-agement of Big Data pipelines across the Computing Continuum remain. The resource management and adaptation for Big Data pipelines across the Computing Continuum require significant research effort, as the current data processing pipelines are dynamic. In contrast, traditional resource management strategies are static, leading to inefficient pipeline scheduling and overly complex process deployment. To address these needs, we propose in this work a scheduling and adaptation approach implemented as a software tool to lower the technological barriers to the management of Big Data pipelines over the Computing Continuum. The approach separates the static scheduling from the run-time execution, em-powering domain experts with little infrastructure and software knowledge to take an active part in the Big Data pipeline adaptation. We conduct a feasibility study using a digital healthcare use case to validate our approach. We illustrate concrete scenarios supported by demonstrating how the scheduling and adaptation tool and its implementation automate the management of the lifecycle of a remote patient monitoring, treatment, and care pipeline.},

Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs have cyclic connections making them powerful for modeling sequences. They have been successfully used for sequence labeling and sequence prediction tasks, such as handwriting recognition, language modeling, phonetic labeling of acoustic frames. However, in contrast to the deep neural networks, the use of RNNs in speech recognition has been limited to phone recognition in small scale tasks. In this paper, we present novel LSTM based RNN architectures which make more effective use of model parameters to train acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition. We train and compare LSTM, RNN and DNN models at various numbers of parameters and configurations. We show that LSTM models converge quickly and give state of the art speech recognition performance for relatively small sized models.},

Three methodologies which are Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and k-Nearest Neighbour are proposed for the algorithm of the predictive model. Focusing on real-life application in Malaysia, two tenants from a commercial building are taken as a case study. The data collected is analysed and pre-processed before it is used for model training and testing. The performance of each of the methods is compared based on RMSE, NRMSE, and MAPE metrics. The experimentation shows that each tenant's energy consumption has different distribution characteristics.},

Further, the schedulers' actions may play an important role in the fulfilment of the generated schedules. The organizational structure with its different responsibilities and conflicting goals may also result in the poor performance of scheduling techniques. Besides these, there is the problem of measuring the quality of a schedule. Discusses the causes for these gaps and illustrates the solutions to improve scheduling by way of a case study.},

  abstract = {Data centers are centralized facilities where computing and networking hardware are aggregated to handle large amounts of data and computation. In a data center, computing resources such as CPU and memory are usually managed by a resource manager. The resource manager accepts resource requests from users and allocates resources to their applications. A commonly known problem in resource management is that users often request more resources than their applications actually use. This leads to the degradation of overall resource utilization in a data center. This paper aims to improve resource utilization in data centers by predicting the required resource for each application. We designed and implemented a neural network model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict more efficient resource allocation for a job based on historical data. Our model has two LSTM layers each of which learns the relationship between: (1) allocation and usage, and (2) CPU and memory. We used Googles cluster-usage trace, which contains a trace of resource allocation and usage for each job executed on a Google data center, to train our neural network. Googles cluster scheduler simulator was used to evaluate our proposed method. Our simulation indicated that the proposed method improved the CPU utilization and memory utilization by 10.71\% and 47.36\%, respectively, compared to a conventional resource manager. Moreover, we discovered that increasing the memory cell size of our LSTM model improves the accuracy of the prediction in return for longer training time.},

  abstract = {Efficient application scheduling is critical for achieving high performance in heterogeneous computing environments. The application scheduling problem has been shown to be NP-complete in general cases as well as in several restricted cases. Because of its key importance, this problem has been extensively studied and various algorithms have been proposed in the literature which are mainly for systems with homogeneous processors. Although there are a few algorithms in the literature for heterogeneous processors, they usually require significantly high scheduling costs and they may not deliver good quality schedules with lower costs. In this paper, we present two novel scheduling algorithms for a bounded number of heterogeneous processors with an objective to simultaneously meet high performance and fast scheduling time, which are called the Heterogeneous Earliest-Finish-Time (HEFT) algorithm and the Critical-Path-on-a-Processor (CPOP) algorithm. The HEFT algorithm selects the task with the highest upward rank value at each step and assigns the selected task to the processor, which minimizes its earliest finish time with an insertion-based approach. On the other hand, the CPOP algorithm uses the summation of upward and downward rank values for prioritizing tasks. Another difference is in the processor selection phase, which schedules the critical tasks onto the processor that minimizes the total execution time of the critical tasks. In order to provide a robust and unbiased comparison with the related work, a parametric graph generator was designed to generate weighted directed acyclic graphs with various characteristics. The comparison study, based on both randomly generated graphs and the graphs of some real applications, shows that our scheduling algorithms significantly surpass previous approaches in terms of both quality and cost of schedules, which are mainly presented with schedule length ratio, speedup, frequency of best results, and average scheduling time metrics.},

Our main contribution is twofold: first, we present a rigorous graph-theoretic framework describing the connecting architectures of RNNs in general. Second, we propose three architecture complexity measures of RNNs: (a) the recurrent depth, which captures the RNN's over-time nonlinear complexity, (b) the feedforward depth, which captures the local input-output nonlinearity (similar to the "depth" in feedforward neural networks (FNNs)), and (c) the recurrent skip coefficient which captures how rapidly the information propagates over time. We rigorously prove each measure's existence and computability. Our experimental results show that RNNs might benefit from larger recurrent depth and feedforward depth. We further demonstrate that increasing recurrent skip coefficient offers performance boosts on long term dependency problems.},
