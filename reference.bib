  abstract = {Time series often have a temporal hierarchy, with information that is spread out over multiple time scales. Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this pa- per we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hi- erarchical processing on difficult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modelling when trained with sim- ple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales.},

  abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {The current superresolution (SR) methods based on deep learning have shown remarkable comparative advantages but remain unsatisfactory in recovering the high-frequency edge details of the images in noise-contaminated imaging conditions, e.g., remote sensing satellite imaging. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based edge-enhancement network (EEGAN) for robust satellite image SR reconstruction along with the adversarial learning strategy that is insensitive to noise. In particular, EEGAN consists of two main subnetworks: an ultradense subnetwork (UDSN) and an edge-enhancement subnetwork (EESN). In UDSN, a group of 2-D dense blocks is assembled for feature extraction and to obtain an intermediate high-resolution result that looks sharp but is eroded with artifacts and noises as previous GAN-based methods do. Then, EESN is constructed to extract and enhance the image contours by purifying the noise-contaminated components with mask processing. The recovered intermediate image and enhanced edges can be combined to generate the result that enjoys high credibility and clear contents. Extensive experiments on Kaggle Open Source Data set, Jilin-1 video satellite images, and Digitalglobe show superior reconstruction performance compared to the state-of-the-art SR approaches.},

However, the performance of one of BEMS applications which is energy consumption prediction has been stagnant due to problems such as low prediction accuracy. Thus, this research aims to address the problems by developing a predictive model for energy consumption in Microsoft Azure cloud-based machine learning platform. Three methodologies which are Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and k-Nearest Neighbour are proposed for the algorithm of the predictive model. Focusing on real-life application in Malaysia, two tenants from a commercial building are taken as a case study. The data collected is analysed and pre-processed before it is used for model training and testing. The performance of each of the methods is compared based on RMSE, NRMSE, and MAPE metrics. The experimentation shows that each tenant’s energy consumption has different distribution characteristics.},

  abstract = {Data centers are centralized facilities where computing and networking hardware are aggregated to handle large amounts of data and computation. In a data center, computing resources such as CPU and memory are usually managed by a resource manager. The resource manager accepts resource requests from users and allocates resources to their applications. A commonly known problem in resource management is that users often request more resources than their applications actually use. This leads to the degradation of overall resource utilization in a data center. This paper aims to improve resource utilization in data centers by predicting the required resource for each application. We designed and implemented a neural network model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict more efficient resource allocation for a job based on historical data. Our model has two LSTM layers each of which learns the relationship between: (1) allocation and usage, and (2) CPU and memory. We used Googles cluster-usage trace, which contains a trace of resource allocation and usage for each job executed on a Google data center, to train our neural network. Googles cluster scheduler simulator was used to evaluate our proposed method. Our simulation indicated that the proposed method improved the CPU utilization and memory utilization by 10.71\% and 47.36\%, respectively, compared to a conventional resource manager. Moreover, we discovered that increasing the memory cell size of our LSTM model improves the accuracy of the prediction in return for longer training time.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we systematically analyze the connecting architectures of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Our main contribution is twofold: first, we present a rigorous graph-theoretic framework describing the connecting architectures of RNNs in general. Second, we propose three architecture complexity measures of RNNs: (a) the recurrent depth, which captures the RNN's over-time nonlinear complexity, (b) the feedforward depth, which captures the local input-output nonlinearity (similar to the "depth" in feedforward neural networks (FNNs)), and (c) the recurrent skip coefficient which captures how rapidly the information propagates over time. We rigorously prove each measure's existence and computability. Our experimental results show that RNNs might benefit from larger recurrent depth and feedforward depth. We further demonstrate that increasing recurrent skip coefficient offers performance boosts on long term dependency problems.},
